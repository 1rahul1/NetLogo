<ul><li> known issues:
<ul><li> the user interface for adding items to the Interface tab is clumsy; we will fix it
</li><li> for the time being, "Save as Applet" requires additional jar files in addition to NetLogoLite.jar
</li><li> many models have been updated to use ticks and tick-based updates, but many others haven't yet
</li><li> for the time being, models run somewhat slower with continuous updates than tick-based updates (even with the display frozen, though not when running headless)
</li><li> with continuous updates, there is not yet a priority system that tries to preferentially place updates at certain special times (e.g. between ticks and between observer steps)
</li><li> there are some plotting bugs; most models are not affected, but please keep an eye out for unusual plotting behavior
</li><li> applets don't have a tick counter or a speed slider
</li><li> in many areas, the documentation has not yet been updated for new features and changes
</li></ul>
</li><li> system:
<ul><li> upgraded JOGL library for 3D view (new version: 20070119-02:11:53)
</li></ul>
</li><li> models:
<ul><li> an automated mechanism is now in place for easily added shared academic credits (e.g. Sengupta &amp; Wilensky instead of just Wilensky) to existing and future models
</li><li> promoted to Sample Models (verified): Planarity, Continental Divide
</li><li> new Code Examples (verified): Link Lattice Example, Link Breeds Example
</li><li> Ethnocentrism is now dated 2003, not 2006
</li><li> improved under development code example: Mouse Drag Multiple Example  
</li><li> new under development code examples: Temporal Anti-Aliasing Example, Hill Climbing Example, Rolling Plot Example
</li><li> new little thing: Uphill Tester
</li><li> improved under development models: Particle Smoke Fountain, Team Assembly 
</li><li> new under development models: body-limb-bones_10_14, Stick Guy, Walker
</li><li> new under development Logo Activities folder with framework for sequenced Logo activities
</li><li> new under development Cities models: Cities Cell, Cities Hood, Cities Path Dependence, Cities Moving
</li><li> new user community models: ejb6, Final_Preliminary_Model, Multi_Exit, Network_growth, Obstruction_Model, web4, MMG
</li></ul>
</li><li> documentation:
<ul><li> renamed Primitives Dictionary to NetLogo Dictionary
</li><li> updated Tutorial 3 to introduce the tick counter
</li></ul>
</li><li> features:
<ul><li> saved applets now work again (had been broken in previous 3.2 and 4.0 prereleases)
</li><li> built in tick counter for keeping track of model time (see language changes, below)
</li><li> new view update system:
<ul><li> there are now two view update modes, tick-based and continuous
</li><li> continuous is the default when you start up NetLogo
</li><li> tick-based is the default for most models in the Models Library
</li><li> using tick-based updates speeds up most models
</li><li> buttons now longer have a "force view update" checkbox; most models will use <tt >tick</tt > or <tt >display</tt > instead
</li><li> many Models Library have been updated to use the tick counter and tick-based updates, but many haven't yet
</li><li> continuous update mode is useful for non-tick based models like Termites, but may also be useful during debugging
</li></ul>
</li><li> improved speed slider:
<ul><li> you can now use the slider to "fast forward" a model (by updating the view less often)
</li><li> in tick-based update mode, going slower pauses between ticks rather than showing intermediate states
</li><li> in continuous update mode, going slower shows intermediate states; you can even go so slow you can watch agents move one at a time
</li><li> speed slider is now located in the Interface tab's toolbar, not the view control strip
</li></ul>
</li><li> monitors now use an auxiliary random generator, so code in monitors won't affect model run reproducibility 
</li><li> the color of text in a note is now editable
</li></ul>
</li><li> language changes:
<ul><li> new tick counter primitives: <tt >tick</tt >, <tt >ticks</tt >, <tt >tick-advance</tt >, <tt >reset-ticks</tt >
</li><li> new <tt >uphill</tt >, <tt >uphill4</tt >, <tt >downhill</tt >, and <tt >downhill4</tt > commands for doing hill-climbing
<ul><li> these new commands replace the old reporters with the same names
</li><li> the new commands have somewhat different semantics that are less prone to problems
</li><li> models using the old reporters will require hand changes 
</li></ul>
</li><li> provisionally, <tt >__without-interruption</tt > now has double underscores, since it is only useful in conjunction with <tt >__ask-concurrent</tt >
</li><li> added new secret <tt >__magic-open</tt > command, which is like the triple underscore thing but lets you put spaces in the search string
</li><li> removed moribund secret prim <tt >__neighbors-hex</tt >
</li></ul>
</li><li> engine fixes:
<ul><li> assorted speed improvements; many models are a little faster now
</li><li> the <tt >display</tt > command now works even when used by a turtle, patch, or link
</li><li> if infinite recursion occurs, NetLogo now reports the error instead of bombing
</li><li> the combination of <tt >one-of</tt > and <tt >with</tt > now exits early once an example is found
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bug where <tt >repeat</tt > and <tt >let</tt > sometimes didn't work properly inside <tt >__ask-concurrent</tt >
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bug in <tt >towards</tt > for turtles near the world edge
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bug in <tt >layout-spring</tt > prim
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bug in GoGo extension
</li></ul>
</li><li> interface fixes:
<ul><li> the Halt item on the Tools menu now works in more situations (rather than hanging NetLogo)
</li><li> "Note" is the new name for the widget formerly known as "Text Box" and "Label"
</li><li> built-in variables are now syntax-colored the same purple as primitive reports
</li><li> if you edit the 2D view, 3D-only properties don't show up
</li><li> fixed Windows-only bug where the 3D view didn't work in Java 1.5.0_10
</li><li> fixed some 4.0-only bugs involving input boxes
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bug where the edit dialogs for buttons didn't resize properly
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bug in patch picking in 3D
</li><li> fixed 4.0-only bugs in runtime error handling for slider bounds
</li></ul>
</li><li> HubNet changes:
<ul><li> new under development activity: Tangrams
</li><li> plot mirroring and narrowcast plotting now work again (they had been broken since 3.2pre4 or so)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<ul><li> extra changes made for June 30 build (earlier build was June 26):
<ul><li> GasLab Free Gas 3D revamped to run faster
</li><li> 2D models are now included again
</li><li> opening a 2D model causes a warning dialog
</li></ul>
</li><li> content:
<ul><li> new Sample Models: DLA 3D, Fireworks 3D, GasLab Free Gas 3D, Percolation 3D, Rope 3D, and Sandpile 3D
</li></ul>
</li><li> features:
<ul><li> NetLogo 3D Preview 3 is based on NetLogo 3.1.1
</li><li> most features available in 3.1.1 are now also available in 3D:
<ul><li> including:
<ul><li> drawing; in 3D the drawing is vector-based rather than pixel-based as it is in 2D, turtles leave behind trails that exist in the same space as the turtles and patches but they cannot be moved or sensed.
</li><li> links suite is supported in 3D; however, layout primitives do not take advantage of the 3D space.
</li><li> __tie and __untie allow turtles to affect the movement of other turtles in 3D space
</li><li> picking patches and turtles from the 3D view
</li><li> 2D shapes are now usable in the 3D view
</li></ul>
</li><li> not including:
<ul><li> topologies (wrapping is not yet optional)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li> many updates and fixes to the 3D view, including the addition of visual wrapping of turtles
</li></ul>
</li><li> language changes:
<ul><li> pitch-up3d, pitch-down3d, left3d and right3d no longer exist; instead, tilt-up, tilt-down, left and right turn up, down,left or right in relation to the turtle, to get the old behavior of pitch-up, pitch-down, left and right you can directly manipulate the heading and pitch variables, though this kind of manipulation is unnecessary in most models
</li><li> other 3D primitives removed (at-points3d, patch-ahead3d, patch-left3d-and-ahead, patch-right3d-and-ahead, diffuse3d); the regular versions now function in 3D
</li><li> diffuse6 is no longer supported in 3D
</li><li> set-gaze-xyz is replaced with facexyz, the observer can also use face and setxyz
</li><li> screen-size-z and screen-edge-z are replaced with world-depth, min-pzcor, and max-pzcor
</li><li> new observer primitives orbit-left, orbit-right, orbit-up, and orbit-down, rotate the observer at a fixed distance around a central gaze point
</li><li> the turtle variable shape3d no longer exists; use the shape variable instead
</li></ul>
</li><li> non-3D-related language changes:
<ul><li> new reporters no-turtles and no-patches
</li><li> new command for turtles and the observer, move-to
</li><li> init blocks are optional on sprout and hatch and create-turtles
</li><li> the __tie and __untie commands now take no inputs and can only be used by link turtles
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<ul><li> when opening models from old NetLogo versions, <tt >user-choice</tt > is now auto-translated to <tt >user-one-of</tt >
</li><li> in the 3D view, patch and turtle labels are now positioned correctly even if the origin is off-center
</li><li> link direction indicators now show up in the 3D view and in HubNet view mirroring
</li><li> fixed bug where the Procedures tab could lose the keyboard focus when the compiler finds an error
</li><li> fixed bug where using the black arrows in the control strip to resize the world could cause incorrect a world size to appear in the strip
</li><li> fixed bug in BehaviorSpace where failure to create an output file caused an uninformative error message

</li><li> changes to how numbers work in NetLogo:
<ul><li> all numbers are now double precision floating point
</li><li> numbers with no fractional part print as integers (without the decimal point)

<ul><li> system:
<ul><li> for Windows users, our bundled Java version is now 1.5 (was 1.4)
</li><li> for Mac users, updated Quaqua support library to Quaqua 3.5_2 
</li></ul>

</li><li> all copyright notices and academic citation info for all models in both the Info and Procedures tabs have been replaced with new, automatically-generated text
</li><li> many models believed to be moribund have been removed from the under development section
</li><li> new code example: Diffuse Off Edges Example
</li><li> eliminated obsolete code examples: Diffuse-Nowrap Example, Even Grid Example
</li><li> new under development models: Airplane Seating, Artificial Neural Net, Bios1, Perceptron, Polarization, Tabonuco Yagrumo, Tabonuco Yagrumo Hybrid, Voronoi, Network Editor Toolkit

</li></ul>
</li><li> features:
<ul><li> randomized scheduling: all agentsets are now always in random order, a different random order each time you use one
</li><li> world topologies:
<ul><li> the world isn't always a torus anymore; by turning vertical and horizontal wrapping on or off, you can choose between a torus, a rectangle, and a vertical or horizontal cylinder
</li><li> using primitives ending in <tt >-nowrap</tt > is no longer necessary; just turn off world wrapping instead
</li><li> new <tt >can-move?</tt > reporter lets turtles sense the world edges
</li><li> see the Topology section of the Programming Guide for more information
</li></ul>
</li><li> new suite of link primitives, no longer secret (no more double underscores); see Links sections of Programming Guide and Primitives Dictionary
<ul><li> it is no longer always necessary to declare a link breed; the standard link primitives use unbreeded links
</li><li> new <tt >links</tt > and <tt >nodes</tt > primitives let you refer to links and non-links even without breeds
</li><li> if you want multiple link breeds, or if you want links to have their own variables, then you must use the old double-underscore link primitives
</li><li> the <tt >layout-spring</tt > command is now faster and less buggy
</li><li> added new secret <tt >__layout-tutte</tt >, <tt >__layout-radial</tt >, and <tt >__layout-magspring</tt > commands
</li></ul>
</li><li> model authors can now specify the singular form of a breed name
<ul><li> the new syntax for declaring each breed is e.g. <tt >breed [wolves wolf]</tt >
</li><li> you can ask for a breeded turtle by i.d. number, e.g. <tt >wolf 0</tt >
</li><li> in model output, breeded turtles also appear as e.g. <tt >wolf 0</tt >
</li><li> this form also appears elsewhere in the user interface, e.g. when picking a turtle from the view, in turtle monitors, and so on
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li> other language changes:
<ul><li> the <tt >sort</tt > and <tt >sort-by</tt > primitives can now be used to convert an agentset to a sorted list of agents; if you use <tt >sort</tt >, turtles are sorted by who number, and patches are sorted left-to-right, top-to-bottom
</li><li> new reporters <tt >random-xcor</tt >, <tt >random-ycor</tt >, <tt >random-pxcor</tt >, and <tt >random-pycor</tt > are handy for generating random coordinates
</li><li> <tt >random-one-of</tt > and <tt >random-n-of</tt > have been renamed to just <tt >one-of</tt > and <tt >n-of</tt >
</li><li> <tt >screen-edge-x</tt > and <tt >screen-edge-y</tt > have been renamed to <tt >max-pxcor</tt > and <tt >max-pycor</tt > (and new <tt >min-pxcor</tt > and <tt >min-pycor</tt > primitives have been added)
</li><li> <tt >screen-size-x</tt > and <tt >screen-size-y</tt > have been renamed to <tt >world-width</tt > and <tt >world-height</tt >
</li><li> removed <tt >no-label</tt > from the language; use the empty string instead
</li></ul>
</li><li> interface changes:
<ul><li> minor improvements to look &amp; feel, e.g. vertical buttons in toolbars instead of horizontal ones
</li><li> the info tabs of saved applets are now more attractive, just like they look in the application
</li></ul>
</li><li> interface fixes:
<ul><li> fixed some incorrectly worded compiler error messages involving variadic prims such as <tt >list</tt > and <tt >sentence</tt >
</li></ul>
</li><li> HubNet changes:
<ul><li> new under development activities: Elevators, Guppy Spots, PNK
</li></ul>
</li><li> API changes:
<ul><li> documentation now recommends using the server VM for best performance

</p><p>changes since 2.0.1:
</p>
<ul><li>system:

</li></ul>
</li><li>interface fixes:

          <li>fixed bug where using <tt>hatch</tt> with a negative number could cause a Java exception (now it just does nothing)
          <li>fixed minor issue where <tt>remove</tt> primitive evaluated its arguments right-to-left instead of left-to-right

        </ul>
      <li>language changes:
        <ul>
          <li>we now support unary minus if you put parentheses around it, so for example you can now write <tt>(- x)</tt> (actually this was true in 2.0alpha1 as well, but we forgot to tell you)
        </ul>

          <li>fixed bug that made plots with large numbers of points (over 10,000 or so) run very slowly, especially on Macs
          <li>fixed bug where some primitives (including <tt>value-from</tt>, <tt>-of</tt>, <tt>distance</tt>, <tt>towards</tt>, and <tt>inspect</tt>) did not deal properly with dead turtles
          <li>fixed bug where under certain very obscure circumstances dead turtles could continue to execute code for a short time after dying
        </ul>
      <li>interface fixes and improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>fixed bug where numbers in sliders displayed in scientific notation could be shown with an incorrect exponent

          <li>renamed <tt>patch-at-distance</tt> to <tt>patch-ahead</tt>
          <li>got rid of <tt>patch-at-distance-and-angle</tt> and replaced it with three new primitives:
            <ul>
              <li><tt>patch-right-and-ahead</tt> and <tt>patch-left-and-ahead</tt> are turtle-only and use relative headings
              <li><tt>patch-at-heading-and-distance</tt> is for both turtles and patches and always uses absolute headings
            </ul>
          <li>renamed <tt>histogram</tt> primitive to <tt>histogram-from</tt> (old models will automatically be updated when opened)
          <li>dropped support for <tt>pc</tt> as an alias for <tt>pcolor</tt> (old models will automatically be updated when opened)

    changes since 2.0pre3:
    <ul>
      <li>system:
        <ul>
          <li>for Mac OS X users, Java 1.4.1 Update 1 is now strongly recommended for running NetLogo (get it through Software Update)
          <li>our bundled Java VM on Windows is now Sun 1.4.2_01 (was 1.4.2)
        </ul>
      <li>known bugs:
        <ul>
          <li>"Import World" done from the File menu doesn't cause the graphics window to update
          <li>"Save as Applet" is disabled
          <li>HubNet may not work fully
          <li>the shapes editor may not work fully
          <li>agent monitors are buggy
          <li>on Windows and Linux, the graphics window sometimes inexplicably becomes very slow; if this happens, you can usually fix it by making screen-edge-x/y very large (like around 200) temporarily, then setting them back to their original values
          <li>the new BehaviorSpace works, but is very bare-bones
          <li>the StarLogoT model converter has been disabled (perhaps permanently)
        </ul>
      <li>content:
        <ul>
          <li>relocated to Sample Models: Turbulence

        </ul>
      <li>features:
        <ul>
          <li>"strict math" mode is now always on, so model results are reproducible cross-platform (this has been true since 2.0pre1, I just forgot to mention it earlier)
          <li>improvements to the new BehaviorSpace:
            <ul>
              <li>added two checkboxes that let you turn graphics window updating and plot/monitor updating on and off
            </ul>
          <li>Ben's peer-to-peer code is now available as an extension
        </ul>
      <li>interface fixes and improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>when turtle shapes are off, if the patch size is at least 5 turtles are now drawn slightly smaller than the patches, so if a turtle is the center of a patch, you can still see the patch color around its edges
          <li>the screen now updates in the middle of buttons runs again, like it used to, undoing change introduced in 2.0pre2
          <li>fixed 2.0pre3-only bug that was making most models with large numbers of turtles run very slowly
          <li>fixed 2.0-only bug where with shapes off and sizes on, big turtles were drawn off-center
          <li>fixed bug where NetLogo would sometimes let you omit the ".nlogo" extension when saving your model
          <li>miscellaneous other fixes too numerous to list
        </ul>
      <li>language changes:
        <ul>
          <li>added new <tt>n-values</tt> reporter for conveniently constructing lists by repeatedly running a reporter
          <li>added new <tt>patch-at-distance</tt> and <tt>patch-at-distance-and-angle</tt> reporters
          <li>added new <tt>shuffle</tt> reporter for shuffling a list
          <li>added new <tt>in-radius-nowrap</tt> reporter
          <li>added new <tt>ifelse-value</tt> reporter (this is the same as what StarLogoT called <tt>ifelse-report</tt>)
          <li>primitives such as <tt>import-world</tt> and <tt>hubnet-set-client-interface</tt> now interpret relative pathnames as relative to the location of the model, not relative to the location of the application
          <li>fixed bug where correct code using the <tt>reduce</tt> primitive would sometimes fail to compile
        </ul>
      <li>HubNet improvements:

          <li>"Save as Applet" is disabled
          <li>HubNet may not work fully
          <li>the shapes editor may not work fully

      <li>features:
        <ul>
          <li>new "Export Graphics" menu item and <tt>export-graphics</tt> primitive let you save the contents of the graphics window to disk as a bitmap (in PNG format)
          <li>added a "Go to User Community Models web page" button to the Models Library dialog
          <li>the old BehaviorSpace has been scrapped and an initial version of a replacement is in this build; it contains only basic functionality, but is already useful, and has the following advantages over the old one:
            <ul>
              <li>you can vary any global variables, not just sliders, but also switches and choices, and any variable declared in the procedures tab, and the values they range over can be any values, not just numbers anymore
              <li>you can enter arbitrary code for "setup" and "go" now, you're not tied to using buttons that exist in your model
              <li>you can vary variables in any order you want, rather than BehaviorSpace choosing the order for you
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>interface fixes and improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>fixed critical bug in 2.0pre2 where plot pens were not saved properly
          <li>fixed bug where if you made changes to your code in the Errors tab and then saved your model without switching tabs first, your changes wouldn't be saved
          <li>in the command center, don't include repeated lines in the history
          <li>fixed 2.0pre2-only bug where moving the mouse over a plot could cause the plot to flicker
          <li>several miscellaneous fixes to agent monitors (better agentset handling, Esc key cancels variable edit in progress, other fixes)
        </ul>
      <li>language changes:
        <ul>
          <li>added new secret primitive <tt>__edit</tt> that lets you save over a model in the models library (note: titlebar doesn't update until after first save)

    changes since 2.0pre1:
    <ul>
      <li>system:
        <ul>
          <li>overall reliability and performance much improved since 2.0pre1
          <li>most models run faster now (typically 15% or so with the display off)
        </ul>
      <li>known bugs:
        <ul>
          <li>BehaviorSpace is disabled
          <li>"Save as Applet" is disabled
          <li>HubNet may not work fully

        </ul>
      <li>features:
        <ul>
          <li>the "Exact Turtle Positions" and "Turtle Sizes" settings have been merged into a single option, and they now much faster and more reliable, so much so, in fact, that they are now on by default! turtle and patch labels are much faster now too
          <li>this the first release of NetLogo to support "extensions": commands and reporters that aren't built-in, but are stored in separate jars (not unlike browser plug-ins); our first extension, "texas.jar", contains some primitives for use by the folks in Texas
        </ul>
      <li>interface fixes and improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>a great many cosmetic issues have been fixed &mdash; the GUI should be in good enough shape now that we're taking bug reports again on cosmetic problems
          <li>graphics window is now flicker-free on all models and all platforms
          <li>graphics are dramatically faster now on the Mac, faster even than in 1.3 native, and almost as fast (sometimes faster) as 1.3 in Classic
          <li>the graphics window now updates only once per button press or button iteration (note: there are still design issues around this we are resolving; let us know if your model has trouble); if you want a graphics update in the middle of a button, use the <tt>display</tt> primitive
          <li>plotting is now faster and never flickers
          <li>agent monitors work again now
          <li>plot editing works again now
          <li>you can now press the Enter or Return key to close dialog boxes
          <li>fixed longstanding Windows bug where the output area of the command center could only hold 25K; there is now no known limit
          <li>agent monitors now report syntax errors to you instead of silently ignoring them
          <li>the variable editors in agent monitors now use syntax highlighting
          <li>fixed 2.0pre1-only bug on Windows where the contents of the graphics window could get mixed up with other widgets
        </ul>
      <li>language changes:
        <ul>
          <li>new experimental secret primitive <tt>__parallel-update</tt> (see ccl-devel archives for discussion)
          <li>new experimental secret primitive <tt>__check-syntax</tt> lets you test to see if a string contains valid NetLogo commands before you call <tt>run</tt> on it
          <li>the color constants (<tt>red</tt>, <tt>blue</tt>, and so on) are now floating point numbers, not integers, since turtle and patch colors are always floating point
          <li>the <tt>display</tt> and <tt>no-display</tt> commands may now be used by turtles and patches as well as by the observer
        </ul>
      <li>content:
        <ul>

          <li>improved under development models: NLVM (implemented patch update with <tt>__parallel-update</tt>, other small fixes and improvements), CA Stochastic (renamed variables, improved info tab), CA Continuous (fixed auto-continue? feature), Tank Wars (has info tab now)
          <li>new under development curricular model: CC KMT (will eventually replace the other KMT models)
          <li>new under development code examples: Plot Pen Modes Example, Reporter vs Variable, Locals Example, File Input Example, File Output Example
          <li>improved under development code examples: File IO Advanced Example (output file name changed), Histogram-list Example (new plot-histogram button, replaced n-values with a repeat [] loop, and code cleanup)
          <li>user community models: Neteffect (new), Sitsim (updated)
        </ul>
      <li>engine fixes:
        <ul>
          <li>fixed bug in <tt>at-points</tt> that could cause an agentset with duplicates in it to be returned
          <li>fixed obscure bug in <tt>die</tt> that caused some models (such as Gas Chromatography) to behave incorrectly
          <li>fixed <tt>towards</tt> (and <tt>towards-nowrap</tt>, <tt>towardsxy</tt>, and <tt>towardsxy-nowrap</tt>) to return numbers in the range [0,360), not [-90,270) as they previously did

      <li>system:
        <ul>
          <li>NetLogo now requires Java 1.4.1 or higher
          <li>NetLogo no longer supports Windows 95, MacOS 8, or MacOS 9
          <li>our user interface now uses Java's Swing toolkit (and not the older AWT toolkit)
          <li>NetLogo now functions more smoothly in many respects on Linux (and probably other Unix systems)
          <li>our bundled Java VM on Windows is now Sun 1.4.2
        </ul>
      <li>known bugs:
        <ul>
          <li>on Macs, the graphics window is much much slower

          <li>agent monitors don't work
          <li>editing plots may not work

          <li>the secret primitive <tt>__agentset-from-list</tt> has been replaced with <tt>__turtles-from-list</tt> and <tt>__patches-from-list</tt>; the new primitives fix at least one bug in the old one and are more powerful (like <tt>turtles-from</tt> and <tt>patches-from</tt>, they can merge not just single agents, but also agentsets and "nobody")
          <li>the <tt>show</tt> primitive now puts double quotes around strings, so you can distinguish them from other values; there is also a new <tt>write</tt> primitive that behaves the same way, but doesn't show the agent
          <li><tt>butfirst</tt> and <tt>butlast</tt> now cause a runtime error if given an empty list as input
        </ul>

      <li>fixed 1.2-only bug where sometimes turtles would fail to draw after you changed the world size
      <li>fixed compiler bug where using <tt>downhill</tt> and other primitives with a variable other than a patch variable would cause a Java exception
      <li>saved applets can now use <tt>import-world</tt>
    </ul>
  <li>interface fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>fixed 1.2-only bug where running some models in BehaviorSpace would slow them down (this was fixed before, but only partially)
      <li>fixed Linux/Unix-only, 1.2-only bug where the agent type selector in the command center didn't work
    </ul>

changes since 1.1 Rev E:
<ul>
  <li>engine fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>the <tt>with</tt>, <tt>in-radius</tt>, and <tt>at-points</tt> primitives now use much less memory than they used to, making it possible to run larger models
      <li>saved applets that use the <tt>show</tt>, <tt>type</tt>, and <tt>print</tt> commands now work even on Java 1.1 VM's
      <li>fixed compiler bug where valid code using the <tt>butfirst</tt> and <tt>butlast</tt> reporters would sometimes fail to compile
      <li>fixed precedence of the <tt>log</tt> reporter, so now for example <tt>log 100 2 + 2</tt> parses as <tt>(log 100 2) + 2</tt> not <tt>log 100 (2 + 2)</tt>
      <li>the <tt>diffuse</tt> and <tt>diffuse4</tt> commands now give a runtime error (instead of a Java exception) when they get non-numeric input
    </ul>
  <li>interface fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>printouts of the Interface tab now contain fewer strange artifacts
      <li>fixed Linux-only bug where contextual menus in the Interface tab didn't work
      <li>pressing the close box on BehaviorSpace's experiment progress dialog now does nothing, instead of making NetLogo get confused
    </ul>
</ul>
