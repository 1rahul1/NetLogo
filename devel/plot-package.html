<p>This package contains classes for plotting.

<p>The lowest level class is PlotPoint.  Each point has x and y
coordinates, a color, and a boolean for whether the pen was down when
the point was plotted.

<p>The next class up is PlotPen.  A PlotPen has a name.  The pen has a
bunch of state variables (with both default and current values) and
remembers all the PlotPoints it has plotted.  The pen's mode
(e.g. line or bar) applies to all of its points.  A pen may be
temporary or permanent; temporary pens go away when the plot is
cleared.

<p>A collection of PlotPens is a PlotPensList.  The pens are ordered,
so they show up in a consistent order in the legend.

<p>The main class is Plot.  A Plot has a name and a PlotPensList, and
keeps track of which pen in the PlotPensList is the current pen.  A
Plot has both default and current values for its ranges (x min and
max, y min and max).  "Auto plot" (whether the range expands
automatically to the fit the data) is a boolean with both default and
current values.

<p>PlotExporter is used to export the plot data in CSV format.

<p>Many classes are serializable in order to support HubNet
plot mirroring.
