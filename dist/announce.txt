The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at
Northwestern University is pleased to announce the release of
NetLogo 5.0, available for free download from our site at
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ .

NetLogo 5.0 is a major release that substantially expands
NetLogo's capabilities.

Please try it out and send us bug reports at bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu
and other suggestions and comments at feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu.
We really value your feedback and look forward to hearing from
you. Please let us know about bugs you find, features you want, etc.

Most models created in earlier versions of NetLogo will work in
NetLogo 5.0, perhaps with minor updates to the code. If you have any
trouble, please consult:
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.0/docs/transition.html .

We are excited by the opportunities resulting from the open sourcing
and internationalization of NetLogo.  We invite our users to help
localize NetLogo in their language, write extensions and publicize
them to the NetLogo community, contribute models to the NetLogo
community models page, and make improvements to NetLogo itself and the
NetLogo User Manual and send us the changes for integration.

The following is a (partial) list of changes made since NetLogo 4.1.3:

* features:
     + open source (GPL license; source code online at
       https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo)
     + new license for Sample Models and Curricular Models is
       Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
     + international characters (Unicode) supported throughout
       application
     + GUI is localized in Spanish, Russian, and Chinese (volunteer
       translators wanted)
     + rich formatting and images in Info tabs using Markdown
     + plotting code goes inside plots
     + authorable model speed (target frame rate setting)
     + buttons optionally disable until ticks start
     + translucent colors in 3D view and NetLogo 3D (for RGB colors
       only)
* language changes:
     + "tasks" store code to be run later
	  - aka first-class functions, closures, lambda
	  - new primitives: task, is-command-task?, is-reporter-task?
	  - these primitives accept tasks: run, runresult, foreach,
	    map, reduce, filter, n-values, sort-by
     + improved overall list performance (many operations take
       near-constant time instead of linear time)
     + you must use reset-ticks to start the tick counter before
       using tick or tick-advance
     + new primitives setup-plots and update-plots
     + new primitive sort-on lets you say e.g. sort-on [size] turtles
     + new primitive error causes a runtime error
     + random-normal rejects negative standard deviations
* HubNet:
     + activities can run headless
     + new primitives hubnet-clients-list, hubnet-kick-client,
       hubnet-kick-all-clients
     + hubnet-set-client-interface no longer required
* other fixes and changes:
     + tabs renamed to Interface/Info/Code
     + Command Center allows reporters, adds show command
       automatically
     + NetLogo 3D uses .nlogo3d not .nlogo
     + import-world is much faster
     + startup no longer runs headless or in background BehaviorSpace
       runs
     + fixed 3D rendering bug where small turtles were too bright
     + Pack200 enabled in applet for faster loading
     + Mac app runs in 64 bit mode by default
     + upgraded Windows installer
     + GoGo extension getting-started experience now smoother on all
       platforms
* models:
     + new Sample Models: Sandpile, Lightning, Osmotic Pressure,
       Robby the Robot, Preferential Attachment 3D
     + new Curricular Models: Bug Hunt Consumers, Bug Hunt Predators
       and Invasive Species, Plant Speciation, epiDEM Basic, epiDEM
       Travel and Control, Connected Chemistry Atmosphere
     + new Code Examples: Info Tab Example, GoGoMonitorSimple


We have four mailing lists for NetLogo:
- netlogo-announce: occasional release announcements only
- netlogo-users: discussions about using NetLogo
- netlogo-educators: discussions about teaching with NetLogo
- netlogo-devel: discussions about the development of NetLogo
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ has info on all four.

NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky, project leader and
director of the CCL.  The lead developer is Seth Tisue.  Many others
have contributed greatly.  HubNet was jointly designed by Uri Wilensky
and Walter Stroup.

The CCL gratefully acknowledges almost two decades of support for our
NetLogo work. Much of that support came from the National Science
Foundation -- grant numbers REC-9814682 and REC-0126227, with further
support from REC-0003285, REC-0115699, DRL-0196044, CCF-ITR-0326542,
DRL-REC/ROLE-0440113, SBE-0624318, EEC-0648316, IIS-0713619,
DRL-RED-9552950, DRL-REC-9632612, and DRL-DRK12-1020101. Additional
support came from the Spencer Foundation, Texas Instruments, the
Brady Fund, and the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems.

Enjoy,
