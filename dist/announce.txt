The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at
Northwestern University is pleased to announce the release of
NetLogo 5.0.1, available for free download from our site at
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ .

Please try it out and send us bug reports at bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu
and other suggestions and comments at feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu.
We really value your feedback and look forward to hearing from
you. Please let us know about bugs you find, features you want, etc.

Most models created in earlier versions of NetLogo will work in
NetLogo 5.0.1, perhaps with minor updates to the code. If you have any
trouble, please consult:
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/transition.html .

The following is a list of changes made since NetLogo 5.0:

 * MODELS?
 * added "wolf" shape to default shapes
 * NetLogo is now buildable on Windows, for open source developers
 * support better JavaScript <=> applet communication
 * bugfixes:
   * `stop` sometimes interfered with later execution
   * `run` of task with `stop` caused exception
   * BehaviorSpace: some normal failures caused bug dialog
   * wrong code font on Windows
   * applets couldn't find extension jars
   * applets didn't work without NetLogoLite.jar.pack.gz
   * attempting to use `?0` crashed compiler
   * model with empty tick counter label couldn't be loaded
   * BehaviorSpace: floating point imprecision could cause last step to be skipped
   * fix to Osmotic Pressure model
   * F1 did wrong lookup on adjacent tokens
   * BadLocationException when using undo and redo in code editor
   * fragile argument parsing in headless.Main
   * agent monitor: NullPointerException in WindowDragger.inCloseBox
   * bad translation key onlyObserverCanAskAllPatches
   * stamped links had incorrect appearance
   * extensions didn't always unload cleanly when opening new model
   * Windows installer didn't install NetLogoLite.jar.pack.gz
   * topology diagram in world settings failed to live-update
   * spurious internationalization-related warnings when running headless
   * `random-seed` primitive discarded high 32 bits of seed
   * applets linked to dead "Get Java" URL
   * BehaviorSpace: runtime errors in metrics resulted in incorrect output
   * Windows-generated applet HTML included backslashes in extension paths
   * tasks: agent-type checker handled task bodies incorrectly
   * NullPointerException in SmartIndenter


We have four mailing lists for NetLogo:
- netlogo-announce: occasional release announcements only
- netlogo-users: discussions about using NetLogo
- netlogo-educators: discussions about teaching with NetLogo
- netlogo-devel: discussions about the development of NetLogo
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ has info on all four.

NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky, project leader and
director of the CCL.  The lead developer is Seth Tisue.  Many others
have contributed greatly.  HubNet was jointly designed by Uri Wilensky
and Walter Stroup.

The CCL gratefully acknowledges almost two decades of support for our
NetLogo work. Much of that support came from the National Science
Foundation -- grant numbers REC-9814682 and REC-0126227, with further
support from REC-0003285, REC-0115699, DRL-0196044, CCF-ITR-0326542,

DRL-RED-9552950, DRL-REC-9632612, and DRL-DRK12-1020101. Additional
support came from the Spencer Foundation, Texas Instruments, the
Brady Fund, and the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems.

Enjoy,
