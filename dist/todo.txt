- Need to add a wsf script which replaces the wxi ampersands with something sensible (like &amp;).

- Need to figure out how to coordinate what is really a "matrix build" with the following:

Product\Platform | Mac | Windows | Linux |
-----------------+-----+---------+-------|
NetLogo JVM      |  x  |   i.p.  |       |
NetLogo 3D       |     |         |       |
NetLogo Logging  |     |         |       |
HubNet Client    |     |         |       |
Meta/Aggregate   |     |         |       |
-----------------+-----+---------+-------+

- Need to get developer ID Application cert to sign mac app

- Need to make sure we get all models out of the models library (per Nicolas's comment)

- Need to exclude QTJava from extensions jars

- Need to get autogenerating version number support

- Need to figure out whether Meta/Agg packages can share jars (on Mac)

- Cross-linking of models

Documentation:

- Review Manual and see how much information is correct and up-to-date

- See if perl documentation can be changed to something else (mustache?)
