The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at
Northwestern University is pleased to announce the release of
NetLogo 5.0beta2, available for free download from our site at
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ .

This is a BETA release of NetLogo. As such, there may be a few bugs.
Please try it out and send us bug reports at bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu
and other suggestions and comments at
feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu. We really value your feedback and look
forward to hearing from you. Please let us know about bugs you find,
features you want, etc.

Most models created in earlier versions of NetLogo will work in
NetLogo 5.0beta2, perhaps with minor updates to the code. If you have
any trouble, please consult:
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.0/docs/transition.html .

As befits the number 5.0, this release has major new features.  Among
those major features are: support for internationalization, smart
plot widgets which eliminate the need for plotting code in the
procedures tab, rich formatting features for the info tab, and
support for functions as first class objects.  We invite and welcome
your comments on the features as well as reports on bugs that you
find.  We are excited by the opportunities resulting from the
internationalization of NetLogo.  The work on internationalization is
not complete and may not be fully complete in version 5.0.  We will
need help from the user community in helping us localize items such
as the menus, error messages, etc.  We are hoping those of you in
locales other than U.S. English will try using NetLogo in your locale
with your local character set and report to us about successes or
problems that you find.

The following is a (partial) list of changes made since NetLogo
5.0beta1:
  
features:
- import-world is a lot faster now
- Programming Guide now has preliminary documentation on tasks

tweaks:
- renamed Run tab back to Interface
- plotting code inside plots is now wrapped in with-local-randomness
- frame rates may now be floating point, and non-positive values are
  rejected
- enabled Github-flavored blank line handling in Info tab

fixes:
- fixed regression where autoconversion wasn't happening properly for
  3D models
- fixed bug where placement of crosshairs in Settings dialog was
  incorrect
- fixed bug where multiple plot pens couldn't be without names
- fixed bug "Open in Transition Guide" button opened wrong version
- fixed regression where NetLogo wouldn't open on Java 5 (e.g. on Mac
  OS X 10.4)
- fixed regression where HubNet clients couldn't use the mouse in the
  view
- fixed intermittent plotting bug
- fixed plot-related error when running BehaviorSpace experiment
- fixed problem with UTF-8 characters in the applet


Please send bug reports to bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu and other
suggestions and comments to feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu.

We also have three mailing lists for NetLogo:
- netlogo-announce: occasional release announcements only
- netlogo-users: discussions about NetLogo
- netlogo-educators: discussions about teaching with NetLogo
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ has info on all three.
