The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at
Northwestern University is pleased to announce the release of
NetLogo 5.0beta4, available for free download from our site at
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ .

This is a BETA release of NetLogo. As such, there may be a few bugs.
Please try it out and send us bug reports at bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu
and other suggestions and comments at
feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu. We really value your feedback and look
forward to hearing from you. Please let us know about bugs you find,
features you want, etc.

Most models created in earlier versions of NetLogo will work in
NetLogo 5.0beta4, perhaps with minor updates to the code. If you have
any trouble, please consult:
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.0/docs/transition.html .

As befits the number 5.0, this release has major new features.  Among
those major features are: support for internationalization, smart plot
widgets which eliminate the need for plotting code in the Code tab,
rich formatting features for the Info tab, transparency in 3D, and
support for functions as first class objects.  We invite and welcome
your comments on the features as well as reports on bugs that you
find.

We are excited by the opportunities resulting from the
internationalization of NetLogo.  The work on internationalization is
not complete and may not be fully complete in version 5.0.  We will
need help from the user community in helping us localize items such as
the menus, error messages, etc.  We are hoping those of you in locales
other than U.S. English will try using NetLogo in your locale with
your local character set and report to us about successes or problems
that you find.

The following is a (partial) list of changes made since NetLogo
5.0beta3:
  
changes since 5.0beta3:
- new HubNet prims: hubnet-clients-list, hubnet-kick-client,
  hubnet-kick-all-clients
- API docs are included again
- misc. fixes to Unicode support
- fixed longstanding bug where 3D objects became brighter the smaller they got
- misc. HubNet fixes

Note also that because of extensions API changes, all extensions must
be recompiled (even extensions that have already been recompiled for
5.0beta3).

Please send bug reports to bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu and other
suggestions and comments to feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu.

We also have three mailing lists for NetLogo:
- netlogo-announce: occasional release announcements only
- netlogo-users: discussions about NetLogo
- netlogo-educators: discussions about teaching with NetLogo
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ has info on all three.
