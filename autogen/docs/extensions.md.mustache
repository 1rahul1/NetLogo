NetLogo allows users to write new commands and reporters in Java and other
languages and use them in their models. This section of the User Manual
introduces this facility and shows how to use an extension in your model once
you have obtained or made one.

Extensions created by members of the NetLogo community are available from
https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Extensions.

For information on creating your own extensions, go
[here](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Extensions-API).

## Using Extensions

To use an extension in a model, add the
[`extensions`](dictionary.html#extensions) keyword at the beginning of the Code
tab, before declaring any breeds or variables.

After [`extensions`](dictionary.html#extensions) comes a list of extension names
in square brackets. For example:

    extensions [sound speech]

Using [`extensions`](dictionary.html#extensions) tells NetLogo to find and open
the specified extension and makes the custom commands and reporters found in the
extension available to the current model. You can use these commands and
reporters just as if they were built-in NetLogo primitives.

### Where extensions are located

NetLogo will look for extensions in several places:

1. In the folder of the current model.
2. The extensions folder located with the NetLogo installation. For typical
   NetLogo installations:

    - On Mac OS X: `/Applications/NetLogo {{version}}/extensions`
    - On 64-bit Windows with 64-bit NetLogo or 32-bit Windows with 32-bit
      NetLogo: `C:\Program Files\NetLogo {{version}}\app\extensions`
    - On 64-bit Windows with 32-bit NetLogo:
      `C:\Program Files (x86)\NetLogo {{version}}\app\extensions`
    - On Linux: the `app/extensions` subdirectory of the NetLogo directory
      extracted from the installation `.tgz`

Each NetLogo extension consists of a folder with the same name as the extension,
entirely in lower case. This folder must contain a JAR file with the same name
as the folder. For example, the `sound` extension is stored in a folder called
`sound` with a file inside called `sound.jar`.

To install a NetLogo extension for use by any model, put the extension's folder
in the NetLogo extensions directory. Or, you can just keep the extension's
folder in the same folder as the model that uses it.

Some extensions depend on additional files. These files will be in the
extension's folder along with the JAR file. The folder may also contain other
files such as documentation and example models.
