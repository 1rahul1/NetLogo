<p>This package contains the non-GUI portions of BehaviorSpace.

<p>All the GUI stuff is in org.nlogo.lab.gui.  Nothing in
org.nlogo.lab depends on anything in org.nlogo.lab.gui.

<p>Here's how the classes in org.nlogo.lab interrelate:

<p>The specification for how to run an experiment is called a
Protocol.  In the GUI, this is called an "experiment setup".
Among other things, a Protocol may contain one or more ValueSets;
each ValueSet specifies what series or range of values a particular
variable should take.

<p>The class that actually runs the experiment, Worker, makes Runner
objects, one per model run, and runs them using a thread pool.  Worker
and its Runners notify a ProgressListener of how things are going.
Off in the org.nlogo.lab.gui package, ProgressDialog implements this
interface and displays the progress in the GUI.

<p>TableExporter and SpreadsheetExporter are also ProgressListeners.
A listener can hang on to the generated results if it wants; that's
how SpreadsheetExporter writes all the data out at once at the end.

<p>Also off in the org.nlogo.lab.gui package, there exists a
Supervisor thread.  Supervisor takes care of creating a Worker and
reporting errors to the user in the GUI.

<p>When running headless, headless.Main uses lab.Lab, which knows how
to use ProtocolLoader to load experiment setups from the model file
or a separate XML file.

<p>Protocols can be written back to disk in XML format by
ProtocolSaver.
