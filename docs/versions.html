      NetLogo. We'd like to hear from you. Please send comments,
      suggestions, and questions to <a href=

    <h2>
      Version 5.0 (coming soon)
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>features:
        <ul>
          <li>Info tabs can now include images and rich formatting, using
          the &quot;Markdown&quot; markup language (#816)
          <li>Unicode is supported throughout the application (#1058)
          <li>GUI is internationalized (but not localized yet except for
          U.S. English and a preliminary Spanish localization) (#812)
          <li>plotting code can now be removed from the Code tab and put
          inside each plot instead (#9)
          <li>the default speed of models is now authorable (via a target
          frame rate setting) (#72)
          <li>buttons can now optionally disable until the tick counter
          starts (e.g., to disable &quot;go&quot; until &quot;setup&quot;
          is pressed) (#1003)
          <li>alpha/transparency is now supported in the 3D view and in NetLogo 3D
          (if you use RGBA colors) (#1092)
          </ul>
      <li>language changes:
        <ul>
          <li>&quot;tasks&quot; let you store code to be run later (#1093)
            <ul>
              <li>also known as first-class functions, closures, and
              lambdas
              <li>two new types: command tasks and reporter tasks
              <li>new primitives: <tt>task</tt>, <tt>is-command-task?</tt>,
              <tt>is-reporter-task?</tt>
              <li>these existing primitives now accept tasks: <tt>run</tt>,
              <tt>runresult</tt>, <tt>foreach</tt>, <tt>map</tt>,
              <tt>reduce</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, <tt>n-values</tt>,
              <tt>sort-by</tt>
              </ul>
          <li>improved overall list performance. <tt>lput</tt>,
          <tt>last</tt>, <tt>butlast</tt>, <tt>item</tt>,
          <tt>replace-item</tt> now take near-constant time instead of
          linear time. internally lists are now hash tries instead of
          singly linked lists (#1211)
          <li>you must now use <tt>reset-ticks</tt> to start the tick
          counter before using <tt>tick</tt> or <tt>tick-advance</tt>; in
          existing models, <tt>clear-all</tt> is converted to
          <tt>__clear-all-and-reset-ticks</tt>; the <tt>reset-ticks</tt>
          part should be moved to the end of your setup procedure (#966,
          #1173)
          <li>plotting code in plots is normally triggered by
          <tt>reset-ticks</tt> and <tt>tick</tt>, but may also be triggered
          by new primitives <tt>setup-plots</tt> and <tt>update-plots</tt>
          (#9)
          <li>new primitive <tt>sort-on</tt> lets you say e.g. <tt>sort-on
          [size] turtles</tt> (#62)
          <li>new primitive <tt>error</tt> lets you cause a runtime error
          (#1243)
          <li>
            <tt>random-normal</tt> now rejects negative standard deviations
            (#732)
          </ul>
      <li>HubNet:
        <ul>
          <li>activities can now be run headless (#1059)
          <li>
            <tt>hubnet-set-client-interface</tt> is no longer required
            (#1130)
          <li>theoretical support for multiple simultaneous client types
          (undocumented) (#1131)
          <li>new primitives: <tt>hubnet-clients-list</tt>,
              <tt>hubnet-kick-client</tt>, <tt>hubnet-kick-all-clients</tt> (#1340)
          <li>removed obsolete <tt>hubnet-broadcast-view</tt> primitive
          (#945)
          </ul>
      <li>other fixes and changes:
        <ul>
          <li>tabs renamed to Interface/Info/Code (#1063)       
          <li>NetLogo 3D now uses a .nlogo3d file extension instead of
          .nlogo (#1117)
          <li>
            <tt>import-world</tt> is a lot faster now (#1272)
          <li>the <tt>startup</tt> procedure no longer runs automatically
          when running headless, or in background BehaviorSpace runs
          (#1202)
          <li>fixed 3D rendering bug where decreasing the size of a turtle
              made it brighter (#1295)
          <li>enabled Pack200 support in the applet for faster loading (#1327)
          <li>BehaviorSpace now uses an official Scala release (2.9.1)
          rather than a nightly build (#1039)
          <li>on Mac OS X, the app now runs in 64 bit mode by default (on
          64 bit machines) (#778)
          <li>upgraded installer for Windows users that we hope will fix
          some installation issues (#838)
          </ul>
      </ul>
