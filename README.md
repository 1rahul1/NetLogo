## Contributions

We are excited by the opportunities resulting from the open sourcing
and internationalization of NetLogo.

We invite our users to help localize NetLogo in your language, write extensions and publicize them to the NetLogo community ([here](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/resources.shtml) and [here](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/netlogo-users/)), contribute models to the [NetLogo community models page](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/), and make improvements to NetLogo itself and the NetLogo User Manual and send us the changes for integration (in the form of pull requests here on GitHub).
